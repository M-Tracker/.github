## Mistake Tracker (GitHub) | Android, Kotlin, Spring Boot
   ## Android
o Developed an Android app using MVVM architecture with Room for local storage.
o Integrated Retrofit with JWT for secure API communication.
o Utilized Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and OkHttp for efficient network calls.
o Used Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations and WorkManager for scheduled sync tasks.
o Implemented Broadcast Receivers for connectivity monitoring and services for background tasks. o Constructed a CI pipeline, ensuring code  quality with JUnit and Espresso for testing.
o Applied GsonConverterFactory with Retrofit for efficient JSON parsing and data handling.
o Handled reactive data with LiveData and built responsive UI components with Jetpack Compose.
  ## Spring Boot
o Developed scalable and secure RESTful APIs for the Mistake Tracker application using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Java, adhering to the MVC architecture, and implementing JWT-based authentication. 
o Integrated Spring Boot with AWS for storage of app-related files in a S3 bucket.
